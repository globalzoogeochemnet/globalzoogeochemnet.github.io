# This is the Global Zoogeochemistry Network website
---

We are a newly formed network of scientists working on different aspects of zoogeochemistry. We are interested in ways in which animals are shaping nutrient landscapes from a broad perspective, beyond any particular animal taxonomic group, spatial scale or ecosystem.

Our overarching vision for this network is to create a platform for collaboration that will promote coordinated, multi-site research projects that will allow for student exchange between systems and participants, cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange and joint funding application development to scale up the impact and reach of zoogeochemistry research.
