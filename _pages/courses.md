> #### Global perspectives on zoogeochemistry, [AIAS][aarhus], Denmark 2023
>---
>
> We hosted 3 full days workshop on **"Global perspectives on zoogeochemistry"** from 10 - 13 October 2023 at the [AIAS][aarhus] in Aarhus, Denmark, which was attended by 30 researchers in the field of zoogeochemistry from around the world.  
>
> The central focus of this workshop was to build a network of people that work on similar topics in different systems with the intention to work more collaboratively in future. This workshop has facilitated meaningful scientific discussions and birthed two concrete products:

> - **Synthesis publication**
> 
> Building on the momentum generated from the insights and discussions in Aarhus, We are currently collaborating on a review paper about the current state of zoogeochemistry, highlighting gaps in our understanding and identifying promising future directions in zoogeochemistry research. _watch this space for updates!_


> - **Key publications in zoogeochemistry**
> 
> We requested folks to submit at least 5 publications that they consider formed an integral part of the development of zoogeochemistry field over the past decade or two. We have compiled these [Zoogeochemistry literatures here][zotero], and if you have other papers you consider to be important just let us know!
